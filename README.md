Deploying Node.js applications with PM2 on Vultr is a streamlined process that ensures efficient performance and easy management of your applications. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the deployment:
Step 1: Set Up Your Vultr Server

   1. ## Create a Vultr Account:
      If you don't have an account, sign up on the Vultr website.

   2. # Deploy a New Server:
        Choose a server location, select a server type (e.g., Ubuntu), and configure the necessary settings.

  3. # Access Your Server:
        Use an SSH client to connect to your server using the provided IP address and login credentials.

* Step 2: Install Node.js and NPM
# Update Package Lists:
```
sudo apt update
```

# Install Node.js and NPM:
```
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```
# Step 3: Install PM2 Globally
* Install PM2:
  ```
  sudo npm install -g pm2
# Step 4: Upload Your Node.js Application
* Transfer Your Application:
        Use SCP or SFTP to upload your Node.js application to your server.

# Step 5: Install Application Dependencies
* Navigate to Your App's Directory:
```
cd /path/to/your/app
```
# Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```
# Step 6: Start Your Node.js Application with PM2
* Start Your Application:
  ```
  pm2 start your-app.js
  ```
# Save the Process List:
  ```
pm2 save
```
# Set PM2 to Start on Boot:
```
pm2 startup
```
# Step 7: Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy (Optional)
* Install Nginx:
```
sudo apt install nginx
```
# Create a New Nginx Site Configuration:

* Configure Nginx to forward requests to your Node.js app.

* Restart Nginx:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx

  ```
# Step 8: Monitor Your Application with PM2

* View Process Status:
```
pm2 status

```
# Monitor Logs:
```
pm2 logs

```
# Paste the following content into the index.js file.
```
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello World, greetings from Vultr</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 3000");
});

```
The code block above defines a basic Express-based application that displays the "Hello World, greetings from Vultr" message when you visit the home page.
